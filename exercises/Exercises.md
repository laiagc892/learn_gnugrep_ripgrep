# Context matching

**a)** For this question, create `exercises/context_matching` directory and then save [this file from learn_gnugrep_ripgrep repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/master/exercises/palindrome.py) as `palindrome.py`. For this input file, display all lines matching `raise` and one line before it.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/context_matching' as CWD
$ grep ##### add your solution here
    if re.search(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ip_str):

# Recursive search

For sample directory, a particular version of one of my GitHub repo is used. All the exercises will assume recursive searching, unless otherwise specified. There are no symbolic links.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises' as CWD
$ mkdir recursive_searching && cd $_
$ repo='https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing.git'
$ git clone -b apr19 "$repo"
$ cd Command-line-text-processing
```

**a)** List all files containing `xargs` or `python3`

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
gnu_grep.md
miscellaneous.md
wheres_my_file.md
exercises/GNU_grep/ex07_recursive_search/progs/hello.py
README.md
```

**b)** List all files containing `grep` but do not list if they are from `.git` or `exercises` directories.

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
gnu_grep.md
sorting_stuff.md
file_attributes.md
whats_the_difference.md
wheres_my_file.md
gnu_sed.md
gnu_awk.md
tail_less_cat_head.md
README.md
ruby_one_liners.md
perl_the_swiss_knife.md
```

**c)** List all files containing `baz` if the filename ends with `.txt` but do not search hidden directories.

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
exercises/GNU_grep/ex12_regex_character_class_part1/sample_words.txt
exercises/GNU_grep/ex16_misc_and_extras/sample.txt
exercises/GNU_grep/ex08_search_pattern_from_file.txt
```

**d)** Search files ending with `.md` only in current directory (i.e. no recursive searching) and count the total number of occurrences of whole words `grep` or `sed` or `awk`.

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
1532
```

**e)** List all files containing `Hello` unless the filename ends with `.txt` or `.sh`

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
gnu_grep.md
miscellaneous.md
file_attributes.md
whats_the_difference.md
gnu_sed.md
gnu_awk.md
tail_less_cat_head.md
exercises/GNU_grep/ex07_recursive_search/progs/hello.py
ruby_one_liners.md
perl_the_swiss_knife.md
```

**f)** List all files containing whole words `awk` and `perl` but not `basename`. Although not the case here, assume that filenames can contain shell special characters like space, semicolon, newline, etc.

```bash
$ grep ##### add your solution here
sorting_stuff.md
gnu_sed.md
gnu_awk.md
ruby_one_liners.md
perl_the_swiss_knife.md
```

# Miscellaneous options

**a)** Use the correct binary option to get output for second command shown below:

```bash
$ printf 'hi there\0good day\n' | grep 'good'
Binary file (standard input) matches

$ printf 'hi there\0good day\n' | grep ##### add your solution here
hi theregood day
```

**b)** Read about `--line-buffered` from the manual (also [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7161821/how-to-grep-a-continuous-stream)) and see it in action with code below:

```bash
$ for i in {1..5}; do seq 12; sleep 1; done | grep '[1-489]' | grep -v '0'

$ for i in {1..5}; do seq 12; sleep 1; done | grep --line-buffered '[1-489]' | grep -v '0'
```

**c)** Consider non-binary input having multiple lines of text. Display `Match` if input starts with a number and `Nope` if it doesn't.

```bash
$ printf 'oh\n42' | grep ##### add your solution here
Nope
$ printf '2a\nhi' | grep ##### add your solution here
Match
```

# Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

**a)** Filter all lines that satisfy all of these rules:

* should have at least two alphabets
* should have at least 3 digits
* should have at least one special character among `%` or `*` or `#` or `$`
* should not end with a whitespace character

```bash
$ pswds='hunter2\nF2H3u#9\n*X3Yz3.14\t\nr2_d2_42\nA $ C1234'
$ printf "$pswds" | grep ##### add your solution here
F2H3u#9
A $ C1234
```

**b)** Extract all fields from second to second last from the given rows having `,` as delimiter. There shouldn't be empty lines in output.

```bash
$ printf 'foo,abc\ncat,x,dog' | grep ##### add your solution here
x
$ echo 'foo,42,baz,3.14,abc' | grep ##### add your solution here
42,baz,3.14
```

**c)** Create `exercises/pcre` directory and then save [this file from learn_gnugrep_ripgrep repo](https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/raw/master/exercises/price.txt) as `price.txt`. For this input file, match lines if it contains `qty` followed by `price` but not if there is **whitespace** or the string **error** between them.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/pcre' as CWD
$ cat price.txt
23,qty,price,42
qty price,oh
3.14,qty,6,errors,9,price,3
42 qty-6,apple-56,price-234,error
4,price,3.14,qty,4
4,qtyprice,3

$ grep ##### add your solution here
23,qty,price,42
42 qty-6,apple-56,price-234,error
4,qtyprice,3
```

**d)** Correct the command to get output as shown below. Problem statement is to find sequence of duplicate word characters, with the second occurrence matching just before a newline character.

```bash
$ # no output
$ printf '2\nice\nwater\nNice\n42' | grep -zoP '(\w+).*\1\n'

$ # correct the command to get expected output as shown
$ printf '2\nice\nwater\nNice\n42' | grep ##### add your solution here
ice
water
Nice
```

**e)** Extract all whole words except those that start with `p` or `e` or `n`

```bash
$ echo 'a pip at tea top earn row nice' | grep ##### add your solution here
a
at
tea
top
row
```

# ripgrep

Would be a good idea to first redo all the exercises using `rg` from all the previous chapters. Some exercises will require reading the manual, as those options aren't covered in the chapter.

**a)** Go through the manual and find an option that will change the line separator from `\n` to `\r\n`. See [Frequently used options](#frequently-used-options) section for details about the input file used here.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/freq_options' as CWD

$ # no output
$ rg -cx '' dracula.txt

$ rg ##### add your solution here
2559
```

**b)** Commands like `sed` and `perl` require special care if you need to search and replace a text literally. `rg` provides an easier alternative, which can be seen with these exercises.

```bash
$ # replace [4]* with 2
$ printf '2.3/[4]*6\nfoo\n5.3-[4]*9\n' | rg ##### add your solution here
2.3/26
foo
5.3-29

$ # replace '3$a with &
$ printf "a'3\$a\nb'3\$a6\nc\n" | rg ##### add your solution here
a&
b&6
c
```

**c)** Create `exercises/ripgrep` directory and then save [this file from learn_gnugrep_ripgrep repo](https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnugrep_ripgrep/raw/master/exercises/sample.md) as `sample.md`. For this input file, match all lines containing `ruby` irrespective of case, but not if it is part of code blocks that are bounded by triple backticks.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises' as CWD
$ mkdir ripgrep && cd $_

$ rg ##### add your solution here
3:REPL is a good way to learn RUBY for beginners.
16:ruby comes loaded with awesome methods. Enjoy learning RuBy.
```

**d)** Sum all integer numbers (floating-point numbers should be ignored) if the file also contains the string `is`

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/ripgrep' as CWD
$ # which already has one file named 'sample.md'

$ # create two more files with these commands
$ echo 'hi,31,3.14,bye' > 'space in filename.txt'
$ echo 'This is 2 good' > $'weird \n symbols'

$ # all three files should be considered as input
$ # use awk '{s+=$1} END{print s}' if datamash is not available
$ rg ##### add your solution here | datamash sum 1
61
```

**e)** Default behavior changes depending upon output is intended for terminal or not. Use appropriate option(s) to get the output as shown below. Search for `good way` or `bye` in all the files in the given directory and save the output in `out.txt` file.

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/ripgrep' as CWD

$ rg ##### add your solution here
$ cat out.txt
space in filename.txt
1:hi,31,3.14,bye

sample.md
3:REPL is a good way to learn RUBY for beginners.
```

**f)** Which option will show both line number and 1-based byte offset of first matching portion for matching lines?

```bash
$ # assumes 'exercises/ripgrep' as CWD

$ # normal output
$ rg 'good' sample.md
3:REPL is a good way to learn RUBY for beginners.

$ # expected output
$ rg ##### add your solution here
3:11:REPL is a good way to learn RUBY for beginners.
```

**g)** By default, `ripgrep` uses `\n` as the line separator. Use appropriate option to change the separator to `NUL` and display all lines containing `red` for the given input.

```bash
$ printf 'dark red\nteal\n\0brown\n\0spared' | rg ##### add your solution here
dark red
teal
spared
```

**h)** Use appropriate options to replace all `NUL` characters with `---` and a newline character as shown below.

```bash
$ printf 'dark red\nteal\n\0brown\n\0spared' | rg ##### add your solution here
dark red
teal
---
brown
---
spared
```
